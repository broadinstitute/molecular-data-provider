Feature: Check ChEMBL transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://molepro-chembl-transformer.test.transltr.io/chembl"


    Scenario: Check ChEMBL producer info
        Given the transformer

    Scenario: Check ChEMBL target transformer info
        Given the transformer

        and the value of "function" should be "transformer"
        and the value of "knowledge_map.input_class" should be "compound"
        and the value of "knowledge_map.output_class" should be "gene"
        and the size of "parameters" should be 0
