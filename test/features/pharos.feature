Feature: Check Pharos transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://translator.broadinstitute.org/pharos"


    Scenario: Check Pharos transformer info
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/gene_targets/transformer_info" query
        then the value of "name" should be "Pharos target genes transformer"

        and the value of "knowledge_map.input_class" should be "compound"
        and the value of "knowledge_map.output_class" should be "gene"
        and the size of "parameters" should be 0
