Feature: Check ChemBank transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://translator.broadinstitute.org/chembank"


    Scenario: Check transformer info
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/compounds/transformer_info" query
        then the size of "parameters" should be 1
        and the value of "label" should be "ChemBank"


    Scenario: Check ChemBank producer - single name
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/compounds/transform" query with the following body:
        """
        {
            "controls": [
                {

                }

        }
        """
        then the size of the response is 2
        and the response contains the following entries in "id"

    Scenario: Check ChemBank producer - multi name
        Given the transformer
