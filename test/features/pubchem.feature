Feature: Check PubChem transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://molepro-pubchem-transformer.ci.transltr.io/pubchem_producer"


    Scenario: Check transformer info
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/transformer_info" query
        then the size of "parameters" should be 1
        and the value of "label" should be "PubChem"


    Scenario: Check PubChem producer - name
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/transform" query with the following body:
        """
        {
            "controls": [
