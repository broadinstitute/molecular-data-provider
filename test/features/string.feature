Feature: Check STRING transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://translator.broadinstitute.org/string"


    Scenario: Check links transformer info
        Given the transformer
        when we fire "/links/transformer_info" query

        and the value of "knowledge_map.input_class" should be "gene"
        and the value of "knowledge_map.output_class" should be "gene"
        and the value of "version" should be "2.3.0"
