Feature: Check SIDER transformer

    Background: Specify transformer API
        Given a transformer at "https://translator.broadinstitute.org/sider"


    Scenario: Check SIDER producer info
        Given the transformer

        and the value of "knowledge_map.output_class" should be "compound"
        and the size of "parameters" should be 1
